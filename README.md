# Handedness Categorization Program

## Overview

The **Handedness Categorization Program** is a simple Python script that categorizes individuals based on their handedness (left-handed, right-handed, or ambidextrous). The user can continuously input names and their respective handedness until they decide to quit. The program stores the categorized names in separate lists and prints them at the end.

- **Lists of Handedness**: Stores names into three separate lists: left-handed, right-handed, and ambidextrous.
- **Quit Option**: Users can exit the program by typing 'quit'.

## Prerequisites

To run this program, you will need:

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Program**: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the Python script is located, and run the following command:
